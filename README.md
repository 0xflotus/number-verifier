Number Verifier is a **SMS verification tool** that makes it easy to get a disposable SMS number and bypass SMS number verifications on any site, for example Facebook, Discord, Twitter, Uber, WeChat, Google & more.

- Written in Golang
- Support for multiple free SMS providers (**PRs are open!**)
- Automatically refreshing of latest messages (5s delay)
- Easy switching between providers

## Usage
To use this tool first download the [latest release](https://github.com/upmasked/number-verifier/releases/latest). If you're using Windows/Mac (darwin)/Linux, and not sure which one to select, you'll probably want to choose the **'amd64'** (=64-bit) variant. After that, extract the package and run it.

## Providers
We currently support the following providers:

- [smsreceivefree](https://smsreceivefree.com/) - Support for free SMS numbers, currently 14 numbers available from the USA.
Messages are stored for up to 7 days.
- [Upmasked](https://upmasked.com/temporary-phone-number/fake-sms) - Support for free SMS numbers, currently 2 numbers available from US & UK. Messages are stored until 50 messages are received.
